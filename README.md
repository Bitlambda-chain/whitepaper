 A New Blockchain Based on a P2P Dynamically Programmable Incentive Protocol

Abstract:

The essence of economics can be succinctly summarized as: "People respond to incentives. The rest is merely explanation." (1)

Blockchain represents a novel method of organizing societal resources, redefining the propositions of "what incentives to use" and "what to incentivize."

This paper introduces a new paradigm, the Lambda Paradigm, which is a novel P2P dynamically programmable incentive protocol capable of operating incentive systems on a large scale and in parallel. It continuously evolves within a self-propagating system, constantly reconfiguring to enable social self-organization to meet its goals, ultimately facilitating the mass production of consensus assets.

This paradigm constructs a permissionless ownership-based monetary container. This monetary container interoperates with the external world through a dynamically programmable incentive protocol and separates incentive consensus computation from the monetary container, thereby accommodating any application, any protocol, and any form of asset.

The goal of the Lambda Paradigm is to adapt to the production, distribution, and trading markets of all consensus assets. Its application scope can extend to any blockchain, any domain, and any form of asset.

In physics, lambda (Λ) represents the cosmological constant, seen as a manifestation of dark energy, influencing the large-scale structure and evolution of the universe.

In the Lambda Paradigm, lambda (Λ) symbolizes a form of consensus asset, impacting the formation and evolution of human assets.
